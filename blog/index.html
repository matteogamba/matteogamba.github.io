Google CEO Larry Page described the profession once as “an ability to lie”. What they describe, however, is antiquated brand marketing. This is quickly getting replaced with “customer acquisition” which can be described as the “science” (not an “art”) of acquiring customers at a lower cost than their value to the business. This is the status-quo in internet marketing — be it e-commerce or services.</p><p name="6bba" class="graf--p"><a id="6bba"></a>A simple example: Subscription websites (think Netflix or match.com) spend $100 to acquire 100 visitors to their website (paying $1 per visitor).
